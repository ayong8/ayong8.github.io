Hello, my name is Yongsu Ahn. I'm a 3rd-year PhD Student in School of Computing and Information at University of Pittsburgh. I'm luckily advised by [Dr. Yu-Ru Lin](http://yurulin.com){:target="\_blank"} at [PICSO Lab](http://http://picsolab.github.io){:target="\_blank"}.

My research interest lies at the intersection of `Visual analytics`, `Fair and Explainable AI`, and `Interactive machine learning`. I'm studying how AI-based tools will better assist the important decision makings and information use in our society. For the heterogenous population users including data practioners, domain experts and lay users, I pursue AI for everyone to develop and promote human-centered AI that is fair, interpretable, and responsible as a viable tool.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
